Fixing the error in Query 5.2

To fix the error, simply change the name of the temporary table to a name that does not conflict with any existing objects in the database, for example:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temporary table_new

AS

SELECT Make, Model, Cost, Manufacture Date, Parts, Warranty Expiry Date

FROM Table1

JOIN Table2 ON Table1.Model_id = Table2.Model_id;
